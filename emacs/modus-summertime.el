(define-minor-mode modus-themes-summertime
  "Refashion the Modus themes by overriding their colors.

This is a complete technology demonstration to show how to
manually override the colors of the Modus themes.  I have taken
good care of those overrides to make them work as a fully fledged
color scheme that is compatible with all user options of the
Modus themes.

These overrides are usable by those who (i) like something more
fancy than the comparatively austere looks of the Modus themes,
and (ii) can cope with a lower contrast ratio.

The overrides are set up as a minor mode, so that the user can
activate the effect on demand.  Those who want to load the
overrides at all times can either add them directly to their
configuration or enable `modus-themes-summertime' BEFORE loading
either of the Modus themes (if the overrides are evaluated after
the theme, the theme must be reloaded).

Remember that all changes to theme-related variables require a
reload of the theme to take effect (the Modus themes have lots of
user options, apart from those overrides).

The `modus-themes-summertime' IS NOT an official extension to the
Modus themes and DOES NOT comply with its lofty accessibility
standards.  It is included in the official manual as guidance for
those who want to make use of the color overriding facility we
provide."
